# Write a shell script finder-app/writer.sh as described below:

# Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem,
# referred to below as writefile; the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred
# to below as writestr

# Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified

# Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file and creating
# the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.

# Example: writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios
# Creates file: /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt
# with content: ios

writefile=$1; writestr=$2

    echo "Error: Missing arguments"
    exit 1

# if [ -f "$writefile" ]; then
#     rm "$writefile"
# fi

if [ ! -d "$(dirname "$writefile")" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$writefile")"
fi

echo "$writestr" > "$writefile" || { echo "Error: Could not create file"; exit 1; }
